# Multi-Cycle RISC Processor

## Overview

This project involves the design and verification of a multi-cycle RISC processor implemented in Verilog. The processor operates on 16-bit instructions and supports four instruction types: R-type, I-type, J-type, and S-type. The design includes eight 16-bit general-purpose registers, a 16-bit program counter, and separate instruction and data memories. The processor is capable of executing a variety of operations, from basic arithmetic to complex memory access and branching.

## Processor Specifications

- **Instruction Size**: 16 bits
- **Registers**: 8 general-purpose 16-bit registers (R0-R7)
  - Note: R0 is hardwired to zero and cannot be modified.
- **Special Purpose Register**: 16-bit Program Counter (PC)

### Instruction Types

- **R-type**: Register-based operations
- **I-type**: Immediate operations
- **J-type**: Jump operations
- **S-type**: Store operations

### Memory Architecture

- Separate data and instruction memories
- Byte addressable
- Little-endian byte ordering

## Features

### Datapath Components

- Instruction memory
- Data memory
- Register file
- ALU
- Extenders

### Control Units

- Main control unit with a state machine to manage instruction execution.
- PC control unit to handle program counter updates based on branching conditions.
- ALU control unit to manage arithmetic and logic operations.

### Simulation and Testing

Comprehensive testing with multiple test cases to ensure correct operation of the processor across various instruction types.

## Project Deliverables

- **Verilog Source Code**: Implementation of the processor components and control units.
- **Test Benches**: Verification of the processor’s functionality through various test scenarios.
- **Project Report**: Detailed documentation explaining the design and implementation, including block diagrams, truth tables, and testing results.
